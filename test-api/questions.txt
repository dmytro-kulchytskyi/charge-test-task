How would you scale this API to process millions of requests?
    -I Have full REST API, so it can be easy be scaled across multiple servers.

What you think would make this API more secure or easily extensible?
    - Use OAuth instead of hardcoded API-key :)
    - Use HTTPS
    - Use Timestamp validation (add it as HTTP request header): this can prevent very basic brute force
